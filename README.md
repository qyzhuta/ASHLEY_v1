# ASHLEY_v1

(Release note: 10/29/2020)
This is a preliminary release version of the ASHLEY model, and details can be found in Zhu et al. (2020), "ASHLEY: a new empirical model for the high-latitude electron precipitation and electric field", submitted to Space Weather. Therefore, the codes are upon changes and improvements, and the updated version will be released in the future.

## ASHLEY
ASHLEY is a new empirical model for the high-latitude electron precipitation and electric field, which consist of three components: ASHLEY-A, ASHLEY-E and ASHLEY-Evar. All those models are developed based on the DMSP SSJ and SSIES measurements.

### ASHLEY-A
The electron precipitation component of the ASHLEY model, which provides the differential energy flux in the 19 DMSP SSJ energy channels under different IMF and solar wind conditions.

### ASHLEY-E
The electric potental component of the ASHLEY model, which provides the large-scale mean electric field under different IMF and solar wind conditions.

### ASHLEY-Evar
The electric field variability component of the ASHLEY model, which provide the uncertainty of the Ed1 and Ed2 components under different IMF and solar wind conditions

## Language 
Python 3 is required

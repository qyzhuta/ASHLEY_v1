# ASHLEY_v1

Source code (v1) of the ASHLEY model

## ASHLEY
ASHLEY is a new empirical model for the high-latitude electron precipitation and electric field, which consist of three components: ASHLEY-A, ASHLEY-E and ASHLEY-Evar. All those models are developed based on the DMSP SSJ and SSIES measurements.

### ASHLEY-A
The electron precipitation component of the ASHLEY model, which provides the differential energy flux in the 19 DMSP SSJ energy channels under different IMF and solar wind conditions.

### ASHLEY-E
The electric potental component of the ASHLEY model, which provides the large-scale mean electric field under different IMF and solar wind conditions.

### ASHLEY-Evar
The electric field variability component of the ASHLEY model, which provide the uncertainty of the Ed1 and Ed2 components under different IMF and solar wind conditions
